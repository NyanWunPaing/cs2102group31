### Setting Up this repo
1. Download NodeJS at https://nodejs.org/en/
2. In a terminal (from vscode or cmd) change directory (cd) to  the folder .../App folder and run 'npm install'. 

A "node_modules" folder should be created in your directory and as this folder shouldn't be pushed to github, I have added it in gitignore. 
3. Go to select.js and change the password field at the Pool code to your postgres password.


### Running the App
1. In your terminal (at .../App), type 'node bin\www'. 
2. Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser for index.ejs. 
3. To stop running the app, aside from closing your browser, remember to Ctrl + C in your terminal to terminate the server.
